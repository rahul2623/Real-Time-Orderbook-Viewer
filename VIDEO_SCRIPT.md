## üé¨ **Video Structure & Script**

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**

*"Hello, this is my submission for the GoQuant Real-Time Orderbook Viewer assignment. I've created a comprehensive Next.js application that not only meets all the core requirements but also includes advanced bonus features that demonstrate professional-grade trading platform capabilities."*

*"The application integrates with OKX, Bybit, and Deribit exchanges and provides real-time order simulation with advanced market analysis tools."*

**[Show]: Application homepage loading at `http://localhost:3000`**

### **1. Application Overview (1 minute)**

*"Let me start by showing you the overall architecture. The application features a modern, professional trading interface with a multi-tab layout."*

**[Show]**: 
- Main interface with three tabs (Overview, Analysis, Advanced)
- Header showing connection status (3/3 Connected)
- Current market display (OKX ‚Ä¢ BTC-USDT)

*"You can see we have three main sections:"*
- *"Overview tab for basic orderbook and simulation"*
- *"Analysis tab for advanced market analysis"*  
- *"Advanced tab for professional trading tools"*

*"The header shows real-time connection status to all three exchanges."*

---

### **2. Core Requirements Demonstration (3 minutes)**

#### **2.1 Multi-Venue Orderbook Display (45 seconds)**

*"Let me demonstrate the core orderbook functionality. Here we have real-time data from OKX showing BTC-USDT with 15 levels of bids and asks."*

**[Show]**:
- Orderbook with 15+ levels
- Real-time price updates
- Bid/Ask spread calculation
- Last updated timestamp

*"Watch the numbers update in real-time - this is live WebSocket data. You can see the spread, cumulative volumes, and the orderbook updating automatically."*

**[Demo]**: Switch venues
- Click Bybit ‚Üí Show venue change
- Click Deribit ‚Üí Show different symbol (BTC-PERPETUAL)
- Return to OKX

*"Notice how seamlessly we can switch between venues, and each maintains its own WebSocket connection with appropriate rate limiting."*

#### **2.2 Order Simulation Form (45 seconds)**

*"Now let's test the order simulation form with all required fields."*

**[Show & Demo]**:
1. **Venue selector** - *"Choose between OKX, Bybit, and Deribit"*
2. **Symbol input** - *"Select from available trading pairs"*
3. **Order type** - *"Market or Limit orders"* (toggle between them)
4. **Side selector** - *"Buy or Sell with visual indicators"*
5. **Price input** - *"For limit orders, with real-time price suggestions"*
6. **Quantity input** - *"With proper validation"*
7. **Timing controls** - *"Immediate, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 30 seconds delay"*

*"All inputs include comprehensive validation and real-time feedback."*

#### **2.3 Order Placement Visualization (90 seconds)**

*"Let's create a simulated order and see how it visualizes in the orderbook."*

**[Demo]**: Create Limit Buy Order
- Set BTC-USDT, Limit Buy, Price: (slightly below market), Quantity: 0.5
- Click "Simulate Order"

**[Show]**:
- Yellow pulsing highlight in orderbook showing order position
- Impact metrics appearing on the right

*"You can see the simulated order highlighted with a yellow pulsing animation in the orderbook. On the right, we get comprehensive impact metrics:"*

- *"Estimated fill percentage: 100%"*
- *"Market impact: minimal"*
- *"Slippage estimation: very low"*
- *"Average fill price and worst-case scenarios"*

**[Demo]**: Create Large Market Order
- Change to Market Order, increase quantity to 10 BTC
- Show impact metrics change dramatically

*"Notice how the metrics change with a larger order - higher slippage, market impact warnings, and detailed recommendations."*

---

### **3. Bonus Features Demonstration (4 minutes)**

#### **3.1 Market Depth Visualization (60 seconds)**

*"Now let's explore the advanced features. Navigate to the Analysis tab."*

**[Show]**: Market Depth Chart
- Interactive area chart with bid/ask visualization
- Hover tooltips showing price and volume details
- Real-time updates

*"This professional market depth chart shows cumulative volume at different price levels. The green area represents bid depth, red represents ask depth."*

**[Demo]**:
- Hover over chart to show tooltips
- Create a limit order and show the yellow reference line on chart
- Switch symbols to show chart updates

*"You can see how our simulated order price appears as a reference line, and the chart updates in real-time with market data."*

#### **3.2 Orderbook Imbalance Analysis (60 seconds)**

*"Below the chart, we have sophisticated orderbook imbalance indicators."*

**[Show]**: Orderbook Imbalance Component
- Volume imbalance percentage and visual bars
- Price-weighted imbalance
- Level count analysis
- Market sentiment classification

*"This analyzes market sentiment by comparing bid and ask pressure across multiple dimensions:"*
- *"Volume imbalance shows buying vs selling pressure"*
- *"Price-weighted analysis considers order values"*
- *"Level count shows market depth distribution"*

*"The system automatically classifies market sentiment as Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral with strength indicators."*

#### **3.3 Advanced Risk Warnings (60 seconds)**

*"The risk analysis system provides intelligent warnings and recommendations."*

**[Show]**: Create high-risk order (large size)

**[Demo]**: 
- Create 50 BTC market order
- Show critical risk warnings appearing
- Display specific recommendations

*"For large orders, the system shows:"*
- *"Critical slippage warnings in red"*
- *"Specific recommendations for order splitting"*
- *"Liquidity analysis showing order size vs available depth"*
- *"Risk summary with color-coded metrics"*

*"Each warning includes actionable recommendations based on current market conditions."*

#### **3.4 Timing Scenario Comparison (60 seconds)**

*"Navigate to the Advanced tab to see timing scenario analysis."*

**[Show]**: Timing Comparison Component
- Scenario selection interface
- Comparison table with multiple timings
- Best/worst scenario identification

**[Demo]**:
- Select different timing scenarios (immediate, 5s, 10s, 30s)
- Show volatility simulation results
- Point out best and worst scenarios

*"This feature simulates how market volatility over time affects order execution:"*
- *"Compare different execution timings side by side"*
- *"Volatility simulation shows potential price movements"*
- *"Automatic identification of optimal timing strategies"*
